Credit Risk Modeling project comparing Logistic Regression and Machine Learning approaches under a financial risk framework.

# Credit Risk Modeling – Europe

## Project Objective

This project analyzes credit risk modeling techniques by comparing traditional logistic regression with machine learning approaches in a financial risk framework.

The main objective is to estimate the Probability of Default (PD) of borrowers and evaluate model performance under risk management criteria.
